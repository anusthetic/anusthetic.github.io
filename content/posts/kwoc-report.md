### INTRODUCTION
I am <a href="https://github.com/anusthetic">Anushka Raj</a>, a first-year undergraduate student of the Department of Computer Science Engineering at IIT Kharagpur with an interest in Web Development and AI/ML.
<br>
I participated in KWoC'25 where contributors work on real-world open source projects. 
This blog documents my contributions in projects and the learnings I gained during the contributions.
<br><br>

### PROJECTS WORKED ON
I worked on the <a href="https://github.com/metakgp/metakgp.org">MetaKGP</a> project, which is a community for open-source enthusiasts at IIT Kharagpur.
<br><br>

### PROBLEM STATEMENT / ISSUES WORKED ON
I created PR's <a href="https://github.com/metakgp/metakgp.org/pull/25">#25</a> and <a href="https://github.com/metakgp/metakgp.org/pull/37">#37</a> which closed issues <a href="https://github.com/metakgp/metakgp.org/issues/14">#14</a> and <a href="https://github.com/metakgp/metakgp.org/issues/18">#18</a>.
<br>

The issues addressed were:
- Cleaning up unused assets
- Compressing large images and changing them to .webp
- Saving images locally that were being extracted externally
- Adding a theme toggler with light theme support
<br><br>

### MY JOURNEY AND APPROACH
Issue #14, Clean up assets
- Identified images that were not being used and removed them
- Converted .png files to .webp and compressed them using Squoosh, a browser-based image compression tool
- Added the `loading="lazy"` attribute to improve page loading speed
- Saved some images locally that were previously loaded from external source
<br><br>
Issue #18, Style Overhaul/Light theme
- Selected a light color that aligned well with the existing design
- Added a custom component for the MetaKGP logo
- Added a theme toggler button in the header section
<br><br>

### LEARNINGS
It was a very nice and valuable experience for me as a first time contributor. I became familiar with Git and Github, React, Typescript, improving UI design, contributing to open-source and understanding how large codebases are structured. 
<br>

KWoC provided me with hands-on experience in contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with maintainers. This experience has motivated me to continue contributing to open source in the future.
<br><br>

### ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank the maintainers and mentors of the MetaKGP project and whole KOSS team for their guidance and feedback during KWoC.
